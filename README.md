# generate-DB-for-library
This is a basic SQL practice exercise where I generate a database file by querring commands and inserting records. 
I begin by declaring the the tables that are going to exist in the database and then I go onto to declare the columns in each of the tables (with the variable type).
Then I begin populating the tables by inserting user input values into each of the columns of the tables thus creating all my records.
At the end of creation and population, I answer some standard queries to fetch the data.
